      "description": "Hello, my name is Marta Deneke, I am originally from Ethiopia. I received my bachelor's in MIS in 2020. Since, the pandemic had just started right before my graduation I had a difficult time finding a job. Which is when I started to look into becoming a Software Engineer and researched diffedrent boot camps. Then, I joined Code Fellows in November. While attending Western Washington Universityy, I worked and volunteered at various companies in order to find my true passion. As a first generation college graduate I have faced different challeneges to be where i am today and once I land my dream job and become a Software Engineer I would like to start a nonprofit in Ethiopia for young women that are intrested in Tech but don't know where to start.",
